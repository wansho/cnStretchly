## Install [![GitHub All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/hovancik/stretchly/total)](https://github.com/hovancik/stretchly/releases) [![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/tiny-repos/stretchly.svg)](https://repology.org/project/stretchly/versions)

The latest official **installers** and **portable versions** for macOS, Windows, Linux and FreeBSD can be found at [Github Releases](https://github.com/hovancik/stretchly/releases) page.

### macOS

You can also install *Stretchly* with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) by running `brew update && brew cask install stretchly`. When upgrading, run `brew update && brew upgrade --cask`. Don't forget to Quit Stretchly, first.

 *Stretchly* is not signed (due to its costs) so you will need to use this workaround for the first run: [Open a Mac app from an unidentified developer](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac).

### Windows

You can also install *Stretchly* with [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) by running the following command from the command line or from PowerShell: `choco install stretchly`. Upgrade with `choco upgrade stretchly`.

Stretchly is also available in Microsoft's [winget](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/).

You can install *Stretchly* for all users silently by running this as administrator: `installer.exe /S /allusers`.

### Linux/BSD/Portable

For portable versions and for Linux/BSD installers, head to [Github Releases page](https://github.com/hovancik/stretchly/releases). The most widely used distributions should be covered.

#### Linux note

Please see http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/tray/ for Electron's Tray Linux specifics. Having `libappindicator1` installed should be enough for *Stretchly*.

For Natural breaks, you might need some packages too (`libxss-dev`).

If *Stretchly* is not starting, you might need to run `sudo sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1`. Read more [here](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/17972). Depending on your distro, you probably want to do something similar to this, so the settings are kept after reboot: Add `kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1` to `/etc/sysctl.d/00-local-userns.conf` and reboot.

### Running from source

To run *Stretchly* from source you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), ideally the one specified in `package.json`. Clone the repo, run `npm install` and then simply run `npm start` to start *Stretchly*.

### Custom installer

You can create a custom installer by running `npm run pack` or `npm run dist` after `npm install --no-save`.

## Default behavior

When you run *Stretchly* for the first time, you are presented with a Welcome window that allows you to change the language, review the settings, view the online tutorial or simply continue with the default settings.

<img src="welcome.png" height="340">

*Stretchly* itself lives in your tray, only displaying a reminder window from time to time, which contains an idea for a break.

<img src="minibreak.png" height="340">

By default, there is a 20 second Mini Break every 10 minutes and a 5 minute Long Break every 30 minutes (after 2 Mini Breaks).

<img src="longbreak.png" height="340">

You'll be notified 10 seconds before a Mini Break (and 30 seconds before a Long Break) so that you can prepare to pause your work.

<img src="notification.png" height="90">

When a break starts, you can postpone it once for 2 minutes (Mini Breaks) or 5 minutes (Long Breaks). Then, after a specific time interval passes, you can skip the break. Both actions are available by clicking on the link at the bottom of window or by using the `Ctrl/Cmd + X` keyboard shortcut.

<img src="skip.png" height="340">

Clicking the *Stretchly* icon in your tray area will display the current status of breaks, provide menu items with extra functionality, and link to the Preferences.

<img src="tray.png" height="140">

*Stretchly* is monitoring your idle time, so when you are idle for 5 minutes, breaks will be paused until you return.  

*Stretchly* is also monitoring Do Not Disturb mode, so breaks are paused when DnD mode is On.

*Stretchly* follows the theme of your system and is also available in dark mode.

<img src="dark.png" height="340">

## Preferences

Most of the preferences can be customized by clicking on the "Preferences" item in the tray menu.

<img src="preferences.png" height="340">

Preferences are divided into multiple categories and you are encouraged to take some time to make *Stretchly* your own by customizing them.

You can also Restore the defaults to return to the default preferences state.

## Advanced Preferences

All preferences are saved in a JSON file. Use the `Ctrl/Cmd + D` shortcut while viewing the About section of Preferences, to show debug info and display a clickable link to the file.

It's recommended to Quit *Stretchly* before editing the preferences file.

To make sure that all works as expected, it's always good idea to check that format of the preferences file is correct, ie. by using [jsonformatter](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/).

Some of the extra settings are available in Contributor Preferences for [Contributors](#contributor-preferences). Those are marked by [![Contributor Preferences](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor_Preferences-✔-success)](#contributor-preferences) badge.

**Note:** Before 1.0, Mini Breaks and Long Breaks were called Microbreaks and Breaks, respectively. To keep the upgrade smooth they still use that name in preferences file and in code.  

#### Editing Break ideas
In the preferences file, change `useIdeasFromSettings: false,` to `useIdeasFromSettings: true,` and edit `breakIdeas` and `microbreakIdeas`.

Note that when a new *Stretchly* version with new break ideas is out, your custom ideas will not be overwritten.

#### Editing Break notification interval [![Contributor Preferences](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor_Preferences-✔-success)](#contributor-preferences)

In the preferences file, change `breakNotificationInterval: 30000,` to whatever value you want. 30000 is 30 seconds. Same goes for Mini Breaks.

#### Editing sunrise time to pause breaks until morning
In the preferences file you can set the `morningHour` setting to pause until that hour today or the next day
Otherwise, you can set `morningHour: "sunrise"` and set `posLatitude`, `posLongitude` in
settings to pause until the actual sunrise in your area.
E.g. if you live in Boston you would set:
`morningHour: "sunrise",`
`posLatitude: 42.3,`
`posLongitude: 71`

#### Editing postpone functionality [![Contributor Preferences](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor_Preferences-✔-success)](#contributor-preferences)
In the preferences file, you can edit `microbreakPostpone` and `breakPostpone` to enable or disable the ability to postpone breaks, `microbreakPostponeTime` and `breakPostponeTime` to change the postpone time in milliseconds, `microbreakPostponesLimit` and `breakPostponesLimit` to change the number of allowed postpones per break, and finally, `microbreakPostponableDurationPercent` and `breakPostponableDurationPercent` to change the percentage of the break during which the user can postpone it.

#### New version notification [![Contributor Preferences](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor_Preferences-✔-success)](#contributor-preferences)
In the preferences file, set `notifyNewVersion: false,` to disable new version notification.

#### Play sound at the start of the Break [![Contributor Preferences](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor_Preferences-✔-success)](#contributor-preferences)
In the preferences file, set `microbreakStartSoundPlaying: true,` to start a Mini Break with a sound (The same sound will be played as at the end of the break). Same for `breakStartSoundPlaying`.

#### Natural breaks inactivity time [![Contributor Preferences](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor_Preferences-✔-success)](#contributor-preferences)
In the preferences file, set `naturalBreaksInactivityResetTime` to your preferred value (in milliseconds greater than than 20000ms). This is an idle time length, after which *Stretchly* breaks will be paused until the user resumes activity.

#### Volume for break sounds [![Contributor Preferences](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor_Preferences-✔-success)](#contributor-preferences)
In the preferences file, set `volume` to your preferred value. Default value is `1`, which is 100% volume. Set it, for example, to `0.61` for 61% volume.

#### Postpone/Finish Break Shortcut
In the preferences file, set `endBreakShortcut` to your preferred value. We do not validate this input, so please check [Electron's documentation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/accelerator) for available values for key and modifier.

#### Appearance [![Contributor Preferences](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor_Preferences-✔-success)](#contributor-preferences)
In the preferences file, change `themeSource: 'system'` to either `'light'` or `'dark'` to always use the specified theme.  

#### Welcome window [![Contributor Preferences](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor_Preferences-✔-success)](#contributor-preferences)
To show the Welcome window again on the next start, change `"isFirstRun"` to `true`.

#### Theme transparency [![Contributor Preferences](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor_Preferences-✔-success)](#contributor-preferences)
To specify how solid the break window should be when Theme transparency is enabled, set the value of `opacity` from `0` to `1` (which is in turn 0 to 100%).

#### Break window size [![Contributor Preferences](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor_Preferences-✔-success)](#contributor-preferences)
To specify the size of the break window, set the value of `breakWindowHeight` and `breakWindowWidth` from `0` to `0.99` (which is in turn 0 to 99% of the size of the screen). Don't set 100% as that's fullscreen.

#### Check for new version
If you don't want to ever check for new version, set `checkNewVersion` to `false`.
